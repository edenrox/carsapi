# Cars API
This project is designed to keep track of makes and models of cars.  Details:

* Written in Java
* Built with Maven
* Runs an embedded [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) web server
* Exposes a REST HTTP API using JAX-RS [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/)
* Stores data in [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Motivation

I wanted to build a REST web service in Java.
